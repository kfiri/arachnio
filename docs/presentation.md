### Goals
In this project, we aimed to assist teenagers in middle and high schools
educating themselves in the world of computer science.

### Gameplay
In the game, each player controls a round creature on a grid of tiles.
Each creature grows larger by eating plant pieces and other, smaller
creatures. The goal of the game is to grow as large as you can, while
avoiding being eaten by creatures larger than you.

Controlling your character is not done through the arrow keys or the
mouse, but rather by coding a bot that can intelligently do so by
itself. However, one must program with care â€“ too much code will bloat
your character, and it will be heavier and slower.
